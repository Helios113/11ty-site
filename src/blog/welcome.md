description: Thoughts on ML research, optimization techniques, and the future of language models.
---

Welcome! I'm starting this blog to share insights from my research at Cambridge on fundamental ML architectures and optimization.

## What I'll Write About

I plan to cover topics including:

- **LLM Optimization**: Techniques for making language models faster and more efficient
- **Research Insights**: Learnings from my work on looped transformers and recursive architectures
- **Future of ML**: Thoughts on next-generation architectures that will power future ML systems
- **Technical Deep Dives**: Implementation details and experiments

## Why This Blog?

I believe in sharing knowledge openly. Many of the challenges I encounter in my research are common across the field, and documenting solutions can help others facing similar problems.

## Stay Connected

I'll aim to post regularly about interesting findings, paper reviews, and implementation notes. If you're working on similar problems or have questions, feel free to reach out!
